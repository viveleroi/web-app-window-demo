            <p>For this demonstration we would like for you to develop a functional application window on a web page. This window should contain basic look and functional behaviors of a typical application window. </p>

            <p>Goals:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</li>
                <li>Everything must be written by you and you alone (no libraries).</li>
                <li>Window should look like an application window</li>
                <li>Window should be able to hide/show</li>
                <li>Window should be able to capable of being dragged over the screen</li>
                <li>You are free to add any other features outside of the basic requirements (feel free to be creative)</li>
                <li>Make sure everything is packaged up so we can view the working product on our end (this includes all of the files)</li>
            </ol>
